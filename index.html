                        COOKIES To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use "cookies", or
                        similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random
                        number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests
                        using the Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through
                        registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a
                        cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information
                        you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie
                        cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to
                        your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.

                        Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection
                        to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a
                        number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as
                        the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this
                        information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the
                        interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the
                        geographic locations from where our visitors come. LINKS TO THE OTHER SITES Our policy
                        discloses the privacy practices for our own web site only. Our site provides links to other

                        third party without obtaining the prior consent of the user in the following limited
                        circumstances:

                        (a) When it is requested or required by law or by any court or governmental agency or

                        detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution and punishment of
                        offences. These disclosures are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure is
                        reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and
                        regulations.

                        (b) We proposes to share such information within its group companies and officers and
                        employees of such group companies for the purpose of processing personal information on its
                        behalf. We also ensure that these recipients of such information agree to process such
                        information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any
                        other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

                        INFORMATION SECURITY We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized
                        access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include
                        internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security
                        measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against
                        unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

                        All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our controlled database.
                        The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is
                        password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures
                        are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database,
                        nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being
                        transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a
                        posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.

                        However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time
                        to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we
                        gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected,
                        regardless of what the new policy may be.

                        Grievance Redressal Redressal Mechanism: Any complaints, abuse or concerns with regards to
                        content and or comment or breach of these terms shall be immediately informed to the
